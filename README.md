I re-visualized the data from an article I had previously published. The *.R files in the `original-plots` folder were used to create the figures in the article. The *.R files in the `better-plots` folder were used to redesign the same figures. The `datasets4plots` folder contains the datasets used in data visualization. The datasets analyzed in the article can be accessed from the [IEA official website](https://www.iea.nl/data-tools/repository/timss). Additionally, I added the appendix dataset (`appendix_a.csv`) from the article to the repository.
